🧠 About Me

I focus on data science, machine learning, and applied mathematics, especially in sports analytics and computer vision. I prefer projects with clear metrics, testable assumptions, and interpretable results.

I primarily work in Python and care more about why a model works (or fails) than blindly improving accuracy.

📌 How I Work
	•	Start with a baseline before complex models
	•	Question the data before tuning hyperparameters
	•	Prefer explainable failure over unexplained success

GitHub is where I test ideas, break assumptions, and refine models — not just where I store finished code.
