👋 Hi, I’m Yejun

About Me

I’m a student developer with a strong interest in data science, machine learning, and applied mathematics. I enjoy building projects that sit at the intersection of theory and real-world systems, especially where algorithms, data, and decision-making meet.

I’m most comfortable working with Python, and I like projects that require structured thinking, clean logic, and measurable outcomes rather than heavy writing or subjective interpretation.

I use GitHub as a workspace for thinking, testing, and refining ideas — not just storing finished code.
